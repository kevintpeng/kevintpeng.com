title: WINRATE AND STATISTICAL ANALYZER FOR DOTA
tech:
  - python
desc: |
  Scrapes aggregated data over millions of data entries for winrate statistics from the popular game Dota 2.

  Analyzes matchups for each hero and creates an index value for a given hero's success against another. The compiled indexes are stored in a table of 100,000 index values that are retreived based on user input.

  A user can input an enemy lineup of up to 5 heroes and Dota Captain will return a list of all remaining heroes in order of statistical success against the input team.
