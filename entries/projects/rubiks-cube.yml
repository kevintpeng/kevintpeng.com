title: Rubik's Cube Solver
tech:
  - java
desc: |
  Using a combination of pattern recognition, smart permutation checks and primative algorithms to piece together a solution to any state of a cube. The cube is graphically displayed as it's geometric net and represented as a 2D array of values. This program currently generates solutions of approximately 100 quarter turns. In comparison, the optimal algorithm (Kociembaâ€™s algorithm) can find a solution to any cube in 26 quarter turns or less.
