    As a part of the Developer Infrastructure team, I developed Shopify's internal tooling for development environments named `dev`, which creates reproducible development environments in one command, similar to `vagrant up`, which replicates the production environment of Shopify, including database sharding and several services like redis and nginx. I rearchitected the development environment tool to support package extensions, containing custom commands, custom tasks to run for projects, and configurations.

    I also built an NGINX reverse proxy that caches dependencies, optimizing bundle install times and mitigating the impact of upstream outages. I deployed the reverse proxy caches using Chef, and provisioned on EC2.
