  - ruby

desc: Used to generate this website! After designing the intended html and css for the web page, repetitive components were modularized, and defined with `YAML` rather than repeating lot's of html. This also let's me use `markdown` format to write notes and blog posts. Generates my Learn Something Everyday notes, using git web hooks.
