desc: The project titled "The Germ-inator" examined the comparison of natural and synthetic anti-microbials. An innovative technique was used to gather precise measurements for bacterial reduction. By taking digital photographs of a petri-dish, a pixel to mm ratio could be determined. Then, specific fine measurements on the dish could be determined through digital analysis.
