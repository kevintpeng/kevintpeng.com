    ### Internal Tooling
    - built a package management system for internal tool `dev`, supporting extensions containing custom commands, custom tasks to run for projects, and configurations
    - open sourced `dev` by utilizing my package system to factor out shopify specific code

    ### Developer Infrastructure
    - architected an NGINX reverse proxy that caches dependencies, optimizing `bundle install` times and mitigating the impact of upstream outages
    - deployed the reverse proxy caches using Chef, and provisioned on an EC2 node
