    #### Internal Tooling
    - developed `dev`; a command-line tool that constructs your development environments and manages your file system
    - built a package management system for `dev`, supporting extensions and configurations
    - prepared `dev` to be open sourced by utilizing my package system to factor out shopify specific code

    #### Developer Infrastructure
    - architected an NGINX reverse proxy that caches dependencies, optimizing `bundle install` times and mitigating the impact of upstream outages
    - deployed the reverse proxy caches using `chef`, and provisioned on an `ec2` node
