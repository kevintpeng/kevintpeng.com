This is my personal website, I've written a site generator to more easily modularize my landing page components. Each entry for work experience, projects, or awards is auto generated, from `/entries/*.yml` files.

### Editing & Developing
This integrates dev, a command line tool that I developed at Shopify. To start editing and developing:

1. Install dev
2. run `dev up`
3. Make changes and run `dev setup` to setup git pre-commit hooks
